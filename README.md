## 32bitALU
# Simulation of a 32 bit unit gate delay ripple carry adder/subtractor using Verilog HDL

Testbench generated for 5000 random inputs for both the first operand and second, as well as subtraction control signal. The average computation speed under the unit gate delay model is around 11.008 nanoseconds, with about 0.5% error margin.
